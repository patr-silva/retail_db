<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<h2 id="about">About the project</h2>
This project is a simple SQL-based online shopping system. It simulates an e-commerce database where internal staff, external partners, customers, products, orders, deliveries, reviews, and payments are managed. This database is designed to capture essential aspects of an online shopping platform, including order processing, payment handling, product tracking, and customer feedback.

<h2 id="goals">Goals and objectives</h2>
This project serves as an exercise to enhance my MySQL skills. While the database is currently functional, I plan to further develop it by creating views for efficient data retrieval, implementing stored procedures for automation and optimization, and integrating a Java GUI for a more user-friendly interface. Additionally, I aim to document the entire project to ensure clarity and maintainability.
